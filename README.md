A ok 2D game engine I'm making

Includes:

 - Player movement with wasd
 - Customisable map
 - Doors with keys
 - Moving view to not show entire map only nearby section
 - Support for different rooms
 - Enemies (with pathfinding) (pathfinding done, just have to add player damage)

Planned features:

 - More enemies
 - Text to right of viewScreen (currently blank)
 - Start screen
 - Goal (end of game)

REQUIRES WINDOWS
(Yes, I will make version for Mac and Linux, it is just two things that dont work (why _getch() and windows escape codes, whyyy))

----WARNING----
You have to scroll all the way to the top before moving otherwise it copies the map that was out of frame (idk why)
